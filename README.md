# VZ200_VZ300_-_1bit_music_TESTED_on_real_VZ200_hardware
2022 dump of 1-bit tunes - all tested on real hardware.  Other 1-bit repositries of mine have not been tested.

Check the .VZ file size.

All .VZ files up to 5.5k will work on a real VZ200. Anything over will not.

All .VZ files up to 15.5k will work on a real VZ300. Anything over will not.

Everything else will require a VZ200+16k or VZ300+16k RAM pack.

.WAV files included to make it easier to load from your computer/phone/MP3 Player direct to your VZ computer.
